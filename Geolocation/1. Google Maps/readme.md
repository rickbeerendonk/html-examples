## How to run
If you run from localhost, you might be required to use an API key.
Instead open the html file from the file system (Windows Explorer or macOS Finder) and the API key is not required, although you will see a [NoApiKeys warning](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/error-messages#no-api-keys).
